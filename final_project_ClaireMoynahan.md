### Project Summary
Nearly one year after its enforcement, General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, legislation demonstrates that government guidance can successfully direct how public governments and private industry use and store digital information and personal identifiable information (PII). GDPR should encourage citizens, both in the EU and abroad, to take a more active interest in protection mechanisms for their online data and information.

### Project Structure

Between 2004-2017 there were over 250 publicly disclosed breaches, these cyberattacks disclosed sensitive information including: PII, passwords, usernames, health information, and credit card banking information. Prior to 2018, there was legislation requiring government and private enterprise to protect health and credit card information, yet there was no legislation requiring governments and enterprise to disclose a breach to the citizens' affected, and to disclose how personal digital information is stored and used. 

In 2017 the EU Data Protection Supervisor (EUDPS) published its annual report highlighting how formal complaints concerning digital privacy have driven its GDPR legislation to protect individuals' onlines privacy and security. On April 14, 2016 EU parliament approved GDPR legislation, and on May 25, 2018 the legislation became enforceable. Since May 25,2018, GDPR has resulted in over 59,000 pubicly disclosed breaches across the EU and UK and over 91 fines. 

These 59,000 publicly-disclosed breaches represent the initial step in ensuring that citizens are provided with transparent, timely, and accurate information regarding online privacy and security. 

### Data

The final project will include a Kaggle database with the details of over 250 data breaches disclosed between 2004-2017. This database includes the entity's Name, Year, Records Lost, Sector, Methods of Leak, Source of the Leak. This Kaggle dataset provides evidence towards the level of personal privacy that citizens all over the world have lost due to data breaches and unauthorized information disclosures, and it  will be compared to the complaints listed in the EUDPS 2017 Annual Report. The EUDPS 2017 Annual Report data included in this report has been gleaned to reflect EU citizens' most common complaints in 2017, one year prior to the enforcement of EUDPS GDPR legislation. The Kaggle and EUDPS datasets will be compared to a survey commissioned by DLA Piper Global Law Firm that highlights the publicly disclosed breaches and locations from May 25,2018 - present. The survey will demonstrate how GDPR legislation represents a successful government response to citizens' data privacy concerns.

### Method & Medium

GDPR legislation was designed to ensure that citizens have the right to know when their data may be compromised, and how governments and private enterprises use and store data. Using data from Kaggle and the EUDPS 2017 Annual Report, I will demonstrate how the severity of data breaches is reflected in the EU citizens' discontent with the lack of transparency surrounding data procurement, usage, and storage. The Kaggle dataset is a quantifiable measure of the volume of personal information disclosed over the past fifteen years, this dataset will be complemented by the EUDPS's 2017 Annual Report, which provides a qualitative measure of citizens' concerns in response to data breaches. 

The Kaggle dataset and EUDPS 2017 Annual Report will be compared against DLA Piper Global Law Firm's *GDPR Data Breach survey*, while only enforceable for 8 months, the survey results demonstrate how GDPR is successfully forcing governments and private enterprise to be accountable for securing personal information. 

I will use Shorthand to demonstrate the progression of data breaches from 2004-2017, citizens' response to the data breaches, and the current measureable effect of GDPR legislation. The storyboard will display the linear progression of over 10 years of data breaches, citizen response, and how GDPR legislation demonstrates a quantifiable response to citizens' concerns.
