### Measuring GDPR Effectiveness - Project Outline


### Project Summary
Nearly one year after its enforcement, GDPR legislation is demonstrating success as a government-enforced response to citizens complaints about the lack of data transparency; GDPR legislation should encourage citizens to take a more active interest in protection mechanisms for their online data and information.

### Project Structure

Setup: In 2017 the EU Data Protection Supervisor (EUDPS) published its annual report highlighting how formal complaints concerning data privacy have driven its GDPR legislation to protect individuals' onlines privacy and security. 

Conflict: In order to adhere to the new government legislation, companies with business in the EU were required to devote attention and resources to ensure that consumer data was processed, used, and stored in a manner adhered to the new laws. 

Resolution: The GDPR is difficult to measure, however as of February 2019, there have been over 59,000 public breach notifications. These notifications represent the initial step in ensuring that citizens are provided with transparent, timely, and accurate information regarding online privacy and security.
