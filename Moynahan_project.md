# Part II User Research Protocol

My data centers upon initial GDPR data which confirms that GDPR legislation has increased the number of disclosed breaches for consumer awareness. My target audience is American citizens who may not be familiar with how GDPR's legislation can provide citizens with more awareness about how their information is used, stored, and deleted. 

In order to gain a sample of this target audience, I chose to interview individuals who do not have prior experience or studies in policy or privacy. Interviewees included a doctor from UPMC, a Masters in Liberal Arts student at Stanford, and a football coach from Ohio. None of these interviewees had previous studies in privacy, or the GDPR legislation. For each individual, I asked them what my wireframe sketches represented and what information the graphs presented. Next I asked the interviewees what information they didn't understand, and what action they would take after seeing this dataset. 

# Interviewee Responses

All three users had confusion about why the US wasn’t present in the bottom graph. The bottom graph lacked labels so they were confused about what the breaches represented. They questioned what companies were breached, and why that information wasn’t present in any of the graphs. They didn't understand how the pie graph of user complaints fit into the dataset.

As the author of the page, I recognized that the data was disjointed, and not clearly synced in a concise argument. I want the reader to see where data breaches were previously disclosed, read users’ complaints about data privacy, then see how the passing of the GDPR resulted in a significant increase in breach disclosures across the EU. For my final project, I plan to accomplish that by displaying previous breaches on a map, using a color scheme to highlight the number from the EU. I will compare those numbers with the current EU breach disclosures from 2018-2019. Both datasets will be displaced on maps, with only the EU countries highlighted in color. The complaints will introduce the second map as the impetus for the change that resulted in GDPR legislation.  

# Final Project Wireframes

Part I.

The below map will replace the bar chart to better highlight the number of publicly disclosed breaches in the EU between 2004-2017

Part II.

The EU citizen complaints will be represented by 8 individuals of different sizes that correspond to the percent of complaints recieved by the EUDPS.

Part III.

The below graph will show how GDPR legislation has effectively increased the number of breach disclosures in the EU; those disclosures provide EU citizens with more awareness about their digital data security.

# Final Data Story

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this story map are non-security professionals. I am currently studying Information Security at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, and one of the primary obstacles to ensuring digital information security is the lack of user awareness and understanding of security principles. The goal of this storyboard was for non-security professionals to review the information, learn what a security breach means, and understand that GDPR is effectively increasing the number of breach disclosures in the EU. 

In order to effectively reach that intended audience, I conducted numerous interviews with the interview subjects from Part II. None of the interview subjects had any prior knowledge of information security, GDPR, or data policy. In addition, none of my interview subjects had taken prior courses in data visualization. After each draft of my final presentation, I showed the three interviewees, and asked them what they understood from the data, and what confused them. Due to their feedback, I included brief definitions and explanations before each chart or map. 

GDPR is an extensive subject, and my data story contained three different data sources. The user feedback was instrumental in helping me focus the story on a particular component of the data to ensure that users will find value from the presented information. During my final draft stage, all three interviewees concurred that they learned something from the data and were interested in learning more about data breach notification legislation.

Work Flow

After the enforcement of GDPR there was much debate about whether companies would comply with the regulations. GDPR is the most extensive piece of privacy legislation, and as a student of security, I am very interested in watching if it's success will result in other nations' to pass similar legislation. The data in my story reflects the first points of data from the legislation; although the regulations and data is less than 1 year old, I do believe that it is evidence that GDPR will direct and influence how cosnumer data is stored and used. 

In order to tell a story from the data, I designed numerous wire frames attempting to simplify the data in order to tell a story, while preserving the data's meaning. Ultimately, it was user feedback that directed my drafts to ensure that my users could understand and follow the story's content. Looking back on the process, I also recognize how difficult it was to compress the data and background into a brief yet meaningful presentation. In addition, sometimes the tools that I wanted to use didn't include the functionality that I envisioned, so I made numerous charts and graphs on different tools, comparing them for aesthetics and usabilty. Ultimately, my final draft utilizes Shorthand, Infogram, and Datawrapper.
