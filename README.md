# Claire Moynahan's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
I am a second year student in the Heinz College MSISPM program. I enjoy learning about information security trends, and playing with data structures. As a security student, I am eager to develop a method of displaying security-related data that tells a story and can be easily understood by a wide community. This summer I will join Salesforce as a Product Security Engineer.   

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about different methods of displaying data related to network security. Last summer I developed a model for displaying data related to enterprise endpoint security. I am looking forward to learning about different methods of displaying data related to information security and enterprise device security.
