# Claire Moynahan's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
I am a second year student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College Masters of Science in Information Security Policy and Management program. Prior to CMU, I received my BA in English from the College of the Holy Cross. I have worked in a data-driven startup in NYC, and in China with the US State Department. This summer I will join Salesforce as a Product Security Engineer.  

I love travelling, my record player, and eating spicy food. 

# What I hope to learn
I enjoy learning about information security trends, and playing with data structures. I hope to learn about different methods of displaying data related to network security. Last summer I developed a model for displaying data related to enterprise endpoint security. I am looking forward to learning about different methods of displaying data related to information security and enterprise device security. I am eager to develop a method of displaying security-related data that tells a story, and can be easily understood by a wide community.
